# Authoring Galaxy User-Defined Tools (UDTs)

A **User-Defined Tool (UDT)** is a tool that a regular (non-admin) Galaxy user defines in YAML
and runs unprivileged, introduced in Galaxy 25.0. It is declared with `class: GalaxyUserTool` and
validated against the `UserToolSource` schema. This skill is the reference for producing a correct,
lint-clean definition.

## When to Use

- The user wants to wrap a command + container as a runnable Galaxy tool they own.
- Triggers: "make me a Galaxy tool that runs X", "wrap this command as a UDT", "create a custom
  tool", "register a tool in my account".
- You are an external agent (Loom, an MCP client, a notebook) that will create/run the tool via
  `create_user_tool` / `run_user_tool` or `POST /api/unprivileged_tools`.

**When NOT to use:** classic XML / ToolShed tool wrappers (Cheetah templating, `tools-iuc`
submission) -- that is a different format; use the `tool-dev` skill instead. A UDT is **not** XML
and does **not** use Cheetah.

## Mental Model (read this first -- it is where agents go wrong)

A UDT = a **container** + a **`shell_command`** + typed **`inputs`** and **`outputs`**.

- The command lives under **`shell_command`** (NOT `command`).
- Parameters are interpolated with **sandboxed ECMAScript inside `$(...)`** -- NOT Cheetah `$x` and
  NOT `#for#` loops. A data file's path is `$(inputs.name.path)`; a scalar value is
  `$(inputs.name)`.
- The `$(...)` templating sandbox has **no database or filesystem access**. Every UDT **must run in
  a container** (`container:` is a required plain string); whether that container has network access
  is set by the Galaxy admin's job config, not by the tool.
- Every **dataset/collection** output must **claim a file** it produced via `from_work_dir` (one
  file) or `discover_datasets` (many) -- you do not write to a templated output path.
- Scalar `text`/`select` values interpolate into `shell_command` **unquoted** (unlike `base_command`
  args, which are `shlex.quote`d) -- a value with spaces or quotes breaks the command. Quote them,
  or pass free text via a configfile. See `references/templating.md`.

If you find yourself writing `command:`, `$param`, `#for#`, `truevalue:`, or `${on_string}`, stop
-- those are XML/Cheetah habits the schema rejects. See `references/common-mistakes.md`.

## Quick Reference -- minimal valid skeleton

```yaml
class: GalaxyUserTool          # required, exactly this
id: my-tool                    # lowercase, ^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$, 3-255 chars (recommended)
version: "0.1.0"               # recommended; must be PEP 440 or create is refused
name: My Tool                  # required, min 5 chars
description: One line shown in the tool menu
container: quay.io/biocontainers/seqkit:2.8.2--h9ee0642_0   # required STRING, a real image
shell_command: |
  seqkit stats --tabular '$(inputs.input.path)' > stats.tsv
inputs:
  - name: input
    type: data
    format: fastq
    label: Input sequences
outputs:
  - name: report
    type: data
    format: tabular
    from_work_dir: stats.tsv        # claim the file the command wrote
    label: Sequence statistics
```

## Authoring Workflow

1. **Understand the command.** What binary runs, what inputs it consumes, what files it produces.
2. **Pick a real container** -- this is the #1 cause of runtime failure. Prefer a verified
   biocontainer (`quay.io/biocontainers/<tool>:<tag>`), but **never guess the `--<hash>_<build>`
   tag suffix** -- it is not predictable. Look up the real tag, or, when the tool needs only the
   Python standard library, use an official `python:3.x-slim` image and write the logic inline.
   **Do not invent an image or flag you cannot verify** -- ask instead. See "Choosing a container"
   below. Lint will *not* catch a bad image; the job simply fails to pull it.
3. **Draft the definition** using `references/schema-reference.md`. Reference each input as
   `$(inputs.name.path)` (data) or `$(inputs.name)` (scalar). Write outputs to fixed filenames and
   claim them with `from_work_dir` / `discover_datasets`. Always include a `help` block (convention
   -- see "Write a help block" below).
4. **Self-review** against `references/common-mistakes.md` (it doubles as a checklist).
5. **Validate** (see below) and iterate on real errors.
6. **Create + run.** Hand the validated definition to `create_user_tool`, then `run_user_tool`
   (this skill stops at a valid definition -- the run/invocation loop is the caller's job).

## Choosing a Container

The container is the part most likely to pass validation but fail at run time, because nothing in
the schema or lint checks that the image actually exists or pulls. A real example: a plotting UDT
that declared `quay.io/biocontainers/seaborn:0.13.2--pyhd8ed1ab_3` was accepted by
`create_user_tool`, then the job died with `manifest unknown` -- that exact build tag did not exist
on quay. Guard against it:

- **Don't guess the biocontainers build suffix** (`--<hash>_<build>`). It is not derivable from the
  version. Look up the real tag: browse `https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/<tool>?tab=tags`
  or query `https://quay.io/api/v1/repository/biocontainers/<tool>/tag/?onlyActiveTags=true`.
- **For a stdlib-only tool, skip biocontainers entirely.** Use an official base image like
  `python:3.11-slim` (or `busybox` for shell-only) and write the logic inline (see the heredoc
  pattern in `references/templating.md`). The seaborn failure above was fixed exactly this way:
  switch to `python:3.11-slim` and emit SVG with the standard library, no third-party image to get
  wrong.
- **Never invent an image, tag, or CLI flag you can't verify** -- ask the user rather than guessing.

## Write a `help` block (convention)

`help` is schema-optional, but **always include a real one**. Galaxy renders it under the parameter
form on the tool page, so a UDT without help is a black box to anyone -- including the same user
weeks later -- who opens it. The wire shape is an object, not a bare string:

```yaml
help:
  format: markdown        # markdown | restructuredtext | plain_text
  content: |
    Cuts a single column from a tab-separated file.

    **Inputs**
    - `input`: TSV file (with or without header).
    - `column`: 1-based column index.

    **Outputs**
    - `output`: TSV with only the selected column, in input row order.

    Header lines are not auto-detected; the column index applies to every row.
```

Three short paragraphs is enough: what the tool does, its inputs/outputs, and any caveat (resource
limits, expected file shape, non-obvious behavior). Don't ship a `TODO` placeholder -- an empty or
stub `help` is no better than none. If help genuinely isn't worth writing (a one-off throwaway), say
so and confirm with the user before creating the tool.

## Validating a Definition

Validation logic is pure Python in `galaxy-tool-util` -- the same code the server runs -- so you can
check offline before submitting. Three tiers, weakest to strongest:

1. **Local** (fast, offline, side-effect-free): `python scripts/validate.py my-tool.yml`. Needs
   `pip install galaxy-tool-util`. Catches structural errors, the four semantic validators, and
   lint warnings. Use this whenever a Python env is available (terminal, CI). See `scripts/`.
2. **`planemo lint`** -- not available yet (planemo does not lint UDTs as of this writing). It
   already depends on `galaxy-tool-util`, so teaching it to lint a `GalaxyUserTool` YAML would be a
   small addition, and it's the natural future home for tier 1. Down the road `scripts/validate.py`
   should migrate to `planemo lint <tool>.yml`, so authors get this check through the standard Galaxy
   tool CLI instead of a bundled script. Until that lands, use tier 1.
3. **Server create** -- `create_user_tool` / `POST /api/unprivileged_tools` runs the same lint and
   confirms *this server* accepts it (needs `enable_beta_tool_formats` + the Custom Tool Execution
   role). This is the final word, and the practical gate for environments without Python (e.g.
   Loom): submit, then iterate on the returned errors.

> **Lint-clean is necessary but not sufficient.** No check here -- not validate.py, not the server's
> create lint -- verifies that the container image actually pulls or that the command succeeds.
> Those only surface when the job runs. A nonexistent container tag (`manifest unknown` at run
> time) is the most common real-world UDT failure, so verify the image (see "Choosing a Container")
> before relying on a clean validation. It also can't see runtime JS-expression errors, shell
> quoting, the server's role/config gates, or whether the command actually produces the declared
> outputs -- only running the tool does.

## Iterating & Cleanup

There is no in-place update API -- every `create_user_tool` call makes a **new** tool. When you
iterate, bump `version` (e.g. `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0`); Galaxy keeps every prior version under the user's
account. **Keep the bumped version PEP 440**: create is refused with
`400 Tool failed lint checks: ToolVersionPEP404` for anything else, so a descriptive scratch version
like `0.1.0-probe` fails while `0.1.0.dev1` or `0.1.0+probe1` works. This is the moment the mistake
happens, because a name is the natural thing to type for a throwaway -- see
`references/schema-reference.md`. Heavy iteration accumulates stale versions, so once a design stabilizes, offer to deactivate
the superseded ones with `delete_user_tool` -- it marks the tool inactive (hidden from the toolbox),
not a hard delete; the records remain.

## Limitations

UDTs deliberately can't reach several things classic tools can (per the Galaxy docs):

- **No reference data** -- no built-in genome indexes or `.loc` files.
- **No metadata files** -- e.g. a BAM index (`.bai`) isn't available; if the command needs one, build
  it inside the `shell_command` or take it as an explicit `data` input.
- **No `extra_files` directory** -- composite / extra-file outputs aren't supported.

Design around these: pass whatever the tool needs as an explicit input, and generate any side files
inside the container.

## Common Patterns

| Goal | shell_command snippet |
|------|-----------------------|
| Single data file path | `tool '$(inputs.reads.path)'` |
| Scalar value | `tool --count $(inputs.count)` |
| Multiple data files | `cat $(inputs.datasets.map(d => d.path).join(' ')) > out.txt` |
| Boolean as a flag | `tool $(inputs.verbose ? '--verbose' : '')` |
| Use the job's allocated cores | `tool --threads $GALAXY_SLOTS` (+ a `resource` requirement, `cores_min`) |
| Capture one output file | declare output with `from_work_dir: out.txt` |
| Capture many outputs | declare output `type: collection` with `discover_datasets` |
| Run a non-trivial inline script | `python <<'PY'` ... `PY` heredoc; reference inputs as `$(inputs.x)` inside (see `references/templating.md`) |

See `examples/` for seven complete, validated UDTs spanning these patterns.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom / error code | Cause | Fix |
|----------------------|-------|-----|
| `dynamic_tool.output_unclaimed` | Output has no `from_work_dir`/`discover_datasets` | Write to a fixed filename and claim it |
| `dynamic_tool.undeclared_input_ref` | `$(inputs.X)` with no input named `X` | Declare the input or fix the name |
| `dynamic_tool.blank_container` | `container` empty / missing | Set a real container image string |
| `string_pattern_mismatch` on `id` | Uppercase, leading digit, spaces | Use `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$` |
| extra-field rejection | XML-ism like `truevalue`, `command`, `${on_string}` | Remove it -- schema is `extra="forbid"` |
| `manifest unknown` / `Unable to find image` at **run** time | Container tag doesn't exist on the registry | Use a real, verified tag (or `python:3.x-slim` for stdlib tools) -- lint can't catch this |
| HTTP 403 "not allowed to run unprivileged" | The admin's job routing (TPV) rejects `tool_type_user_defined` by default | Not fixable client-side -- the admin must add a destination/routing rule for user-defined tools |
| `help` rejected at create | `help` sent as a bare string | Use the object form: `help: {format, content}` |
